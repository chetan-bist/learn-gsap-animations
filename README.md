# learn-gsap-animations
🎯 A collection of practice animations built using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). This repository includes examples of basic to advanced GSAP features such as .to(), .from(), timelines, scroll-based animations, easing, and more.

📁 Each folder or component focuses on a specific animation concept, with clean code and comments to make learning easier. Ideal for beginners and frontend developers who want to create high-performance and visually engaging animations for modern web projects.

🚀 Covered Topics:
- Basic element transitions (x, y, scale, rotation, opacity)
- Timelines for sequential and overlapping animations
- ScrollTrigger for scroll-based effects
- Easing functions and custom ease curves
- Animation control (pause, resume, reverse)
- Chaining multiple animations
- Staggered animations (multiple items animate in sequence)
- Hover & click based animations
- Delays and repeat/yoyo effects
- Responsive animations using media queries
- MotionPath animations (follow a path)

📦 Bonus Concepts:
- React integration with GSAP
- Tailwind CSS + GSAP styling and animation synergy
- Component-based animations
- Scroll-based animations in React using useEffect
- Reusable animation hooks or components (in React)

📌 Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP 3.x (via CDN or NPM)

🔰 Purpose:
To document and practice my learning journey with GSAP and how it integrates with modern frontend tools like React and Tailwind CSS. This repo serves as a reference and animation playground for future projects.
